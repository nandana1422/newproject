   <br>
   <h2 style="font-style: oblique;font-size:30px">Purplle is an Indian e-commerce platform that specializes in beauty and personal care products. It was founded in 2012 by Manish Taneja and Rahul Dash, who were both alumni of the Indian School of Business. Purplle initially started as a blog that provided beauty tips and product reviews, but later expanded into an online marketplace.

    Since its inception, Purplle has grown to become one of the largest beauty e-commerce players in India. The company has raised over $296 million in 14 rounds of funding from investors like IvyCap Ventures, Blume Ventures, and JSW Ventures. As of 2021, Purplle has over 30,000 products from more than 650 brands, including some of the most popular brands in the industry such as Lakme, Maybelline, L’Oreal, and Neutrogena.</h2>
    <h2 style="font-style: oblique;font-size:30px;">Purplle operates on a marketplace model, which means that it partners with various sellers and brands to offer a wide range of products to its customers. The company has also launched its own private label, called Good Vibes, which offers a range of affordable and high-quality beauty products.

        In addition to its e-commerce platform, Purplle also operates over 10 offline stores across India, including in cities like Mumbai, Pune, and Bangalore. The company also has a mobile app, which has been downloaded over 10 million times on the Google Play Store.
        
        One of the key factors contributing to Purplle’s success is its focus on affordability and accessibility. The company offers a wide range of products at competitive prices, and has implemented various initiatives to make it easier for customers to shop for beauty products online. For example, Purplle offers free shipping on orders over Rs. 699, and has a flexible return policy that allows customers to return products within 7 days of delivery.
